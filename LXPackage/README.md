# DuckPond LX Package

An LX Package containing lighting patterns for the DuckPond Bar umbrella installation.

## Overview

This package provides 9 different lighting patterns optimized for umbrella fixtures with spoke-based LED arrays. Each pattern is designed to work with fixtures tagged as "umbrella" in the LX model.

## Included Files

### Patterns
- 9 individual lighting patterns (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter, etc.)
- Base UmbrellaPattern class with coordinate transformation

### Fixture Definitions  
- **umbrella.lxf** - Single umbrella fixture for testing
- **umbrellas.lxf** - Complete 11-umbrella DuckPond Bar installation

### Utilities
- LXFloat4 and Gradient classes for color calculations

## Patterns

### Seasonal Effects
- **Spring** - Rainbow gradient with local coordinate modulation
- **Summer** - Rainbow gradient with global coordinate sparkles  
- **Autumn** - Rainy gradient with autumn colors
- **Winter** - Winter gradient with rainy overlay

### Atmospheric Effects
- **After Rain** - Rainbow gradient with rotating motion
- **Sunset/Sunrise** - Happy gradient transitioning to evening colors

### Environmental Themes
- **Desert Dream** - Desert colors with local and global movement
- **In The Jungle** - Jungle colors with dark light overlay

### Utility
- **Test Strip** - Cycles through LEDs one at a time for testing

## Installation

This package is designed to work with the LX Package system. To use:

1. Build the package: `mvn clean package`
2. The JAR will be created in the `target/` directory
3. Install the JAR in your LX installation

## Requirements

- LX Framework v1.1.0 or higher
- Java 8 or higher
- Model with fixtures tagged as "umbrella"

## Using the Fixture Files

The package includes two LXF fixture definition files:

1. **umbrella.lxf** - Use for testing individual umbrella patterns
2. **umbrellas.lxf** - Complete installation file with:
   - 11 umbrella fixtures positioned as in the physical DuckPond Bar
   - ArtNet output configuration for IP addresses 10.10.33.1-11
   - 80 LEDs per umbrella (8 spokes Ã— 10 LEDs)

## Fixture Requirements

The patterns expect fixtures to be tagged with "umbrella" and work best with:
- Radial spoke-based LED arrangements
- 3D positioned models where local coordinates matter
- Models with proper center and bounds calculation

## Building

```bash
cd DuckPondPackage
mvn clean package
```

The built JAR will include all necessary metadata for LX Package recognition.

## Original Implementation

These patterns are based on the original DuckPond Bar lighting system, refactored to work as individual LX patterns using the modern LX framework's model hierarchy and tagging system.
