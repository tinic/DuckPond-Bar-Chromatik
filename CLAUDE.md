# DuckPond Bar Chromatik LED Art Installation

A headless LED art installation system for DuckPond Bar, migrated to the modern LX framework. This project controls LED lighting for umbrella fixtures and bar-top strips, providing atmospheric lighting effects for the venue.

## Project Overview

**License:** MIT License  
**Author:** Tinic Uro  
**Copyright:** 2019 Tinic Uro  
**Framework:** LX LED Framework v1.1.0  
**Language:** Java  
**Build System:** Apache Ant  

## Architecture

This is a headless Java application that runs lighting patterns on physical LED fixtures:

- **11 Umbrella fixtures** - Each with configurable spokes and LEDs per spoke (default: 8 spokes, 10 LEDs/spoke)
- **Bar top fixture** - Front and back LED strips following the bar contour
- **Network output** - ArtNet protocol to individual fixture IP addresses

## Key Components

### Main Application
- `DuckPondBarHeadless.java` - Main entry point and model builder
- Builds 3D model from physical fixture definitions
- Manages ArtNet network output and pattern execution
- Can load LX project files or run default patterns

### Pattern System
- `DuckPondBarPattern.java` - Base pattern class with 9 built-in effects
- **Effects available:**
  - Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter (seasonal themes)
  - AfterRain, SunsetSunrise (atmospheric effects)
  - DesertDream, InTheJungle (environmental themes)
  - TestStrip (debugging/testing)

### Fixture Classes
- `DuckPondFixture.java` - Abstract base fixture with coordinate mapping
- `UmbrellaFixture.java` - Radial spoke-based LED fixtures
- `BarTopFixture.java` - Linear strip fixtures following bar contour

### Network Setup
- `NetworkSetup.java` - Configures ArtNet output to fixture IP addresses
- Splits fixtures into appropriate ArtNet universes
- Handles both umbrella and bar-top fixture addressing

### Utility Classes
- `LXFloat4.java` - 4D vector math for color and position calculations
- `Gradient.java` - Color gradient system with RGB/HSV support

## Build Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Java 8 or higher
- Apache Ant

### Available Build Targets

```bash
# Compile source code
ant compile

# Build project (compile + verification)
ant build

# Run the application
ant run

# Create JAR package
ant jar

# Clean, build, and package
ant all

# Clean build directory
ant clean
```

### Runtime Usage

```bash
# Run with default pattern using convenience script
./DuckPondBarHeadless

# Run with project file
./DuckPondBarHeadless DuckPond.lxp

# Or use ant directly
ant run

# Or use java directly
java -cp "lib/*:build/classes" duckpond.DuckPondBarHeadless project.lxp
```

## Physical Setup

### Umbrella Layout
```
Physical umbrella positions (11 total):
    11    13    15    17    19
 10    12    14    16    18    20
```

### Network Configuration
- **Protocol:** ArtNet (UDP port 6454)
- **Umbrella fixtures:** IP addresses `10.10.33.1` through `10.10.33.11`
- **Bar top fixture:** `10.10.33.20` (if enabled)
- **Universe mapping:** Universe 0 for umbrellas, Universe 0+1 for bar top
- **Data splitting:** Up to 170 LEDs per ArtNet universe (510 bytes)

### Fixture Specifications
- **Umbrella fixtures:** 8 spokes Ã— 10 LEDs = 80 LEDs each
- **Bar top fixture:** 400+ LEDs in front strip, 400+ LEDs in back strip
- **Total LEDs:** ~1,680 LEDs across all fixtures

## Pattern Development

### Effect Calculation
Each fixture implements `calc(Effect effect, int index, double time, LXFloat4 position)`:
- **effect** - Selected visual effect enum
- **index** - LED index within fixture
- **time** - Current time for animation
- **position** - 3D world position of LED

### Adding New Effects
1. Add effect to `DuckPondBarPattern.Effect` enum
2. Implement effect case in each fixture's `calc()` method
3. Use gradient system for smooth color transitions

### Gradient System
- Supports RGB and HSV color modes
- Methods: `reflect()`, `repeat()`, `clamp()`
- Pre-built gradients for seasonal and atmospheric themes

## Configuration

### Umbrella Parameters
- `spokes` - Number of radial spokes (3-16, default: 8)
- `ledsPerSpoke` - LEDs per spoke (1-20, default: 10)
- `spokeLength` - Physical spoke length in meters (default: 0.305m)
- `centerOffset` - Center offset for LED positioning (default: 0.045m)

### Pattern Parameters
- `effect` - Selected visual effect
- `speed` - Animation speed multiplier (-10 to +10)

## Development Notes

### Build System
- Uses Apache Ant with standard Java project structure
- Framework JAR included in `lib/` directory
- All dependencies self-contained

### Testing
- `TestStrip` effect cycles through individual LEDs for fixture verification
- Use Wireshark or tcpdump to monitor ArtNet packets: `sudo tcpdump -i any -n udp port 6454`
- Verify packets are sent to correct fixture IP addresses

### Performance
- Headless operation for production deployment
- Optimized vector math in `LXFloat4` class
- Efficient gradient lookups with 256-point resolution

## Dependencies

- **LX Framework:** `lib/lx-1.1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar`
- **Java Standard Library:** Math utilities, collections, networking

## Migration Notes

This project has been migrated from the original `heronarts.lx.headless.duckpond` package structure to the simplified `duckpond` package for easier maintenance. Key improvements:

- **Simplified package structure:** All classes now in `duckpond` package
- **Modern LX API usage:** Updated to LX framework v1.1.0 APIs
- **ArtNet output:** Properly configured for individual fixture IP addresses
- **Convenience script:** `DuckPondBarHeadless` executable for easy deployment
- **Clean build system:** Standard Maven-style directory structure with Ant

## Troubleshooting

**Version warnings:** When loading old project files, you may see:
```
[LX] Failed to parse LX version identifier: Couldn't parse: 0.1
```
This is expected and non-fatal - the project will still load successfully.

**Network verification:** To verify ArtNet packets are being sent:
```bash
# Monitor all ArtNet traffic
sudo tcpdump -i any -n udp port 6454

# Test fixture connectivity
ping 10.10.33.1  # Test umbrella 1
ping 10.10.33.20 # Test bar top
```

This project represents a complete LED art installation system, providing both the technical infrastructure and artistic content for atmospheric venue lighting.
